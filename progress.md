# Performance hillclimb (branch `perf/hillclimb`)

Goal: make the core pipeline (read → normalize → HVG → PCA → neighbours → Leiden → UMAP) as fast as
possible, keep the parity gates (ARI ≥ 0.9 vs Seurat and vs planted types; bench/README.md), and
produce a benchmark for a 3-minute demo talk.

Constraints from the user (2026-10-17):
- Modal budget about $20–25 total. L4 for sweeps, one H100 run for the headline.
- Parity gates stay. Commit after each change. Local branch only; no push.
- Modal CLI: `uvx modal` (profile mukeshkbj). No Docker locally. `goalctl` is not installed.
